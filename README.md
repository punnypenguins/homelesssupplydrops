# homelesssupplydrops
Repository to track the supplies, donations, organizing/strategies, and drop-offs I do for homeless people in the STL area around highway ramps. 

**NOTE:** Money donations, cash flow of donations in and out, and the names of people who donated money are not going to be listed in this public repository. I'm keeping that information in an encrypted setup on my personal network. That's not the internet's business. If you're someone who's trying to do similar work and want to know how I keep track of that, though, I'm happy to explain my system for it to you if you message me.

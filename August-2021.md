# 270 and Olive Blvd.:

### Dropped off: 
Ice, ziploc bags, Tylenol, Aleve, Zyrtec, electrolyte packets, medium tote bag, loaf of bread, SPF 70 sunscreen, spare change in ziploc. 

### Spotted in the usual spot by the ledge:
- partly-empty water bottles
- toothbrush **(TODO: add some tooth brushes and cheap plastic tooth brush holder-cases to shopping list so I can pass those out too)**
- new and unused water bottles (shoutout to whoever is dropping one or two off every so often at that corner!)
